Rapid Impact Lead Form Builder (Helix-Informed)

This application is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for the "Rapid Impact Lead Form" service. It serves two purposes:

Sales Tool: Allows you to demonstrate to prospective clients exactly how customizable their high-ticket lead form will be.

Visualization: It visualizes the "invisible" value of the backend "Helix Engine" (Phase 2).

How to Use

Phase 1: Configuration (Left Panel)

The sidebar on the left represents the Client Experience customization. You can adjust:

Brand Integration: Change the company name, logo text, primary/accent colors, and typography style.

Messaging: Rewrite the headline, subtext, and CTA button to match specific high-ticket offers (e.g., "Strategy Audit" vs "Consultation").

Strategic Gathering: Toggle specific fields on/off (Budget, Timeline, etc.) to demonstrate how the form adapts to qualify leads.

Note the "Guild Insight" tooltips which provide context on why these elements matter, based on the framework provided.

Phase 2: Helix Engine Simulation (Right Panel interaction)

Fill out the form in the Preview area on the right.

Click the CTA Button (e.g., "Request My Strategy Audit").

The Helix Engine Overlay will appear. This simulates the backend logic described in the document:

Secure Data Capture: Simulates server-side encryption.

Qualification Logic: Simulates the Helix framework filtering the lead.

Notification: Simulates the instant email dispatch to the client team.

Technical Notes

Responsive Design: The layout stacks on mobile devices. Use the floating "Edit/View" toggle in the top right corner on mobile screens.

Tailwind CSS: All styling handles dynamic colors via inline styles for the user-selected accents, while structure is handled by utility classes.
